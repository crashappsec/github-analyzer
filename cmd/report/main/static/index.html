                  Control flow integrity (CFI) restricts jumps and
                  branches within a program to prevent attackers
                  from executing arbitrary code in vulnerable
                  programs. However, traditional CFI still offers
                  attackers too much freedom to chose between valid
                  jump targets, as seen in recent attacks.
                  <br><br>
                  We present a new approach to CFI based on
                  cryptographic message authentication codes (MACs).
                  Our approach, called cryptographic CFI (CCFI),
                  uses MACs to protect control flow elements such as
                  return addresses, function pointers, and vtable
                  pointers. Through dynamic checks, CCFI enables
                  much finer-grained classification of sensitive
                  pointers than previous approaches, thwarting all
                  known attacks and resisting even attackers with
                  arbitrary access to program memory.
                  <br><br>
                  We implemented CCFI in Clang/LLVM, taking
                  advantage of recently available cryptographic CPU
                  instructions (AES-NI). We evaluate our system on
                  several large software packages (including nginx,
                  Apache and memcache) as well as all their
                  dependencies. The cost of protection ranges from a
                  3--18% decrease in server request rate. We also
                  expect this overhead to shrink as Intel improves
                  the performance AES-NI.

                  Several defenses have increased the cost of
                  traditional,
                  low-level attacks that corrupt control data, e.g.
                  return
                  addresses saved on the stack, to compromise
                  program execution.
                  In response, creative adversaries have begun
                  circumventing
                  these defenses by exploiting programming errors to
                  manipulate
                  pointers to virtual tables, or vtables, of C++
                  objects. These attacks
                  can hijack program control flow whenever a virtual
                  method of
                  a corrupted object is called, potentially allowing
                  the attacker to
                  gain complete control of the underlying system. In
                  this paper we
                  present SAFEDISPATCH, a novel defense to prevent
                  such vtable
                  hijacking by statically analyzing C++ programs and
                  inserting
                  sufficient runtime checks to ensure that control
                  flow at virtual
                  method call sites cannot be arbitrarily influenced
                  by an attacker.
                  We implemented SAFEDISPATCH as a Clang++/LLVM
                  extension,
                  used our enhanced compiler to build a vtable-safe
                  version of
                  the Google Chromium browser, and measured the
                  performance
                  overhead of our approach on popular browser
                  benchmark suites.
                  By carefully crafting a handful of optimizations,
                  we were able to
                  reduce average runtime overhead to just 2.1%
